## Abstract
> Breast cancer represents one of the diseases that make a high number of deaths everyyear. 
> It is the most common type of all cancers and the main cause of women's deathsworldwide. 
> Classification and data mining methods are an effective way to classify data.
> Especially in the medical field, where those methods are widely used in diagnosis and analysis to make decisions.

## Problem Statement
> Given the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass, predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer using the Ensembling Techniques. Perform necessary exploratory data analysis before building the model and evaluate the model based on performance metrics other than model accuracy.

## Dataset Information:
> The dataset consists of several predictor variables and one target variable, Diagnosis. The target variable has values 'Benign' and 'Malignant', where 'Benign' means that the cells are not harmful or there is no cancer and 'Malignant' means that the patient has cancer and the cells have a harmful effect
